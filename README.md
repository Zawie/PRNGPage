# Psuedo Random Number Generator Page
This webpage generates noise and statistics from specific pseudorandom number generators to visualize the randomness of these functions. 

# Possible Modifications
On line 63 you can change the random function being used. Change the r value to whatever function you wish to use. The current valut is "adamRandom()" but one may use "lcg()" or "middleSquareMethod()".

To change the scale of the noise (and hence the amount of random numbers) simpley change the canvas dimensions on line 6.

Feel free to modify it and test it out yourself! :)
